# Synology_Photos-Tweaks
Synology Photos is easily the most feature rish self-hosted photo manager...but damn is it ugly. This repo is where I will begin to list any modifications I create or find across the internet to enhance Synology Photos. 

Dark CSS Theme:
- d2.css
- This is a nearly complete dark theme created by me. I couldnt stand the bright white theme of the stock Photos webUI, I couldnt find any existing userstyles, so I made my own. 

I'll update this with more details as I clean everything up. I have currently only tested this theme by loading it through the inspector in WaterFox and Fluid(WebKit SSB for MacOS). I am not a web developer, just someone who doesnt take no for answer, so please let me know if you find any issues or elements that were missed. 

ABOUT:

- Completely custom dark theme, instead of generating something with a browser extension, I decided to dig through the inspector and hand theme each element. 
- Should be well over 90% complete, but I'm always open to refinements and new ideas. 
- The header logo is completely custom, and created by me. I will upload a higher resolution version at some point. 
- Many of the icons used throughout the UI have been replaced using icons from https://icons8.com/
- The terrible placeholder images for an empty library, empty albums page, empty share page, etc, have all been replaced. 
- Added a transparent black background to the time displayed over videos to increase readability. 
- Increased the Opacity of the hover shadows on images, and the album description gradient to increase readability. 

ISSUES:

- The main loading throbber is still white.
- The "Processing..." throbber is still white.
- The Prev and Next buttons in the image lightbox are still the stock color. 
- Some text input fields are still white, however the text is a constrasting color so this doesnt affect useability.
- The timeline scrollbar is not fully themed. 
- Dropdown menus, and the background of the lightbox seem to use the same color value. 

As I said above, im not a web developer, most of the issues are simply because I cannot figure out how to fix them so any help is greatly appreciated. 

ENOY!
