# Synology_Photos-Tweaks
Synology Photos is easily the most feature rish self-hosted photo manager...but damn is it ugly. This repo is where I will begin to list any modifications I create or find across the internet to enhance Synology Photos. 

Dark CSS Theme:
- d2.css
- This is a nearly complete dark theme created by me. I couldnt stand the bright white theme of the stock Photos webUI, I couldnt find any existing userstyles, so I made my own. 

I'll update this with more details as I clean everything up.
